          question: "What is DataArc's dynamic knowledge base?",
          answer: "DataArc's dynamic knowledge base (Context Graph) is a structured data management system that captures and organizes enterprise information to build context graphs, helping teams manage and utilize knowledge efficiently while optimizing model training."
        },
        {
          question: 'How is the knowledge graph constructed?',
          answer: 'With DataArc, enterprises transform internal data sources into structured graphs. The system automatically gathers policies, documents, and reports, converts them into triplets (e.g., policy-applies-enterprise), and links them to improve data processing and knowledge management efficiency.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How can I query data with the DataArc knowledge base?',
          answer: 'The knowledge base supports structured and natural language queries. Leveraging context understanding, users enter a question or filter, and the system extracts relevant knowledge from the graph to deliver accurate results.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can the DataArc knowledge base integrate with existing enterprise systems?',
          answer: 'Yes. The DataArc knowledge base integrates with enterprise management systems, CRM, ERP, and more. Flexible APIs and technical support help connect the context graph with other business systems.'

        },
        {
          question: 'How is synthetic data quality ensured?',
          answer: 'DataArc employs advanced generation algorithms and quality evaluation systems to maintain statistical fidelity while ensuring diversity and realism, with continuous monitoring to keep data quality high.'
